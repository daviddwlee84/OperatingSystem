## OS vs. Hardware

1. CPU
   * Register
2. Interrupt

### 1. CPU

![Top-Level View of Computer Organization](https://voer.edu.vn/file/11893)

#### Register

* User visible register: used by high-level compiler, to reduce the memory access times
  * data register (general purpose register)
  * address register
    * index register
    * segment pointer
    * stack pointer
  * condition code register
    * overflow
    * sign
* Control and State register (Only accessible with authority)
  * PC Program Counter
  * IR Instruction Register
  * PSW Program Status Word
    * [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_status_word)
      * Interrupt masks
      * Privilege states
      * Condition code
      * Instruction address
    * [PSW](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci360/hchnotes/psw.htm)
      * a collection of data 8 bytes (or 64 bits) long
      * maintained by the operating system
      * keeps track of the current state of the system

#### Protection

Hardware support:

* Executing different instruction set on different authority level.
* Seperate OS and user program.

#### Status of CPU / Mode

Use PSW

Eflags register in x86

#### Privileged Instructions

> Privileged Instructions: Can only be used by OS. (can't be used by user)

* Kernel Mode: running system program
* User Mode: running user program

privilege instruction: the instruction can only used by system

*Trap instruction* is non-privileged instruction (訪管指令)

* [Wiki - Trap (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_(computing))

> Example of X86: 4 different privilege
>
> * R0: kernel state
> * R1
> * R2
> * R3: user state
>
> In most of the x86 processor only use R0 and R3 privilege

#### CPU Mode Transform

* User Mode -> Kernel Mode
  * Only way: Interrupt/Exception/Trap Mechanism 中斷/異常(例外)/陷入機制
* Kernel Mode -> User Mode
  * Setting PSW to user mode

e.g. int, trap, syscall, sysenter/sysexit => 訪管指令 （不同系統implement的名稱可能不同）

### 2. Interrupt/Exception Mechanism

> OS is *interrupt triggered* or *event triggered*
>
> * [Wiki - Interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)
> * [Wiki - Exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling)

Origin of Interrupt and Exception:

* Interrupt: Support parallel operation between CPU and device
* Exception: Problem appear while CPU executing instruction

#### Concept

* CPU "react" to an "event"

1. CPU stop the running process
2. Preserve the scene (PC, PSW)
3. Execute the handler for the "event"
4. After finish, back to the break point
   1. If it's system call then advance PC
   2. If other exception then don't advance PC
5. Continue executing

#### Event

* (External) Interrupt
  * I/O interrupt
  * Time interrupt
  * Hardware failure
* Exception (Internal Interrupt)
  * **System call**
  * **Page fault** 頁錯誤/故障
    * 缺頁異常
  * Protectional exception
  * Break point instruction
  * Other programming exception
    * e.g. overflow

-|Unexpected|Deliberate
---------------------|-----|------------
**Exceptions (sync)**|fault|syscall trap
**Interrupt (async)**|interrupt|software interrupt

> * Interrupts: asynchronous interrupts generated by hardware.
> * Exceptions: synchronous interrupts generated by the processor.

Class|Reason|Async/Sync|Return behavior
-----|------|----------|---------------
Interrupt|I/O device, peripheral|Async|Always return to next instruction
Trap|Arrange intentionally|Sync|Return to next instruction
Fault|Recoverable error|Sync|Return to current instruction
Abort|Unrecoverable error|Sync|Don't return

#### Interrupt Response

> Discover interrupt -> Receiving interrupt

![Instruction Cycle with Interrupts](https://voer.edu.vn/file/11888)

![Transfer of Control with Multiple Interrupts](https://voer.edu.vn/file/11899)

In the last step of execution cycle, it will scan the interrupt register check if there is interrupt signal

If there is an interrupt, then interrupt hardware will send the "interrupt code" in the corresponding position in PSW. Through switching *interrupt vector* to call the interrupt handler.

#### Interrupt Vector Table (IVT)

It's a unit in the memory. Store the entry address of interrupt handler and PSW.

* [Wiki - Interrupt vector table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table)

> Linux interrupt vector
>
> * [128 (0x80)](#system-call-in-linux-based-on-x86): for system call (programmable exception)

#### Interrupt handler

* [Wiki - Interrupt handler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler) (中斷處理程序)

Procedure

1. Preserve relative registers
   * PC
   * PSW
2. Analysis the reason of Interrupt / Exception
3. Execute the corresponding funciton
4. Resume and return to the original program

Example of I/O Interrupt:

* I/O operation end normally
  * Wake up the process which is waiting for the result
* I/O operation fail
  * Retry the fail operation
  * Reach the tolerance maximum, determine as hardware failure

Implementation of Timer Interrupt:

* System necessary
* Software clock
* CPU scheduling
  * Round Robin
* Timing task
* Real-time execution

Hardware Fault Interrupt

Program Interrupt

#### Interrupt in IA32

> IA32 = Intel's 32-Bit computer architecture = x86 (comes from the Intel Processor model number "Intel 8086") ([explained](http://lyberty.com/tech/terms/x86_WHAT-IS_.html))

* Interrupt
* Exception 異常
* System Call

IA32 system structure

![IA32 system structure](https://images0.cnblogs.com/blog/706575/201501/031410301699609.png)

* Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC / PIC)
  * Transfer the *hardware interrupt signal* to *interrupt vector*, trigger CPU interrupt
* Interrupt Vector Table (Real Mode)
  * Store the *address of **interrupt handler***
    * handler entry address = segment base address + offset
* Interrupt Descriptor Table (Protection Mode)
  * Use data structure *gate descripter* to describe interrupt vector

Gates in Interupt Descriptor Table

* Task Gate
* Interrupt Gate
* Trap Gate
* Call Gate

![stackoverflow IDT Gate Descriptors](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItKOI.png)

Procedure of Interrupt in x86

1. Get the *interrupt vector* (i)
2. Use IDTR find IDT then get *interrupt descriptor* (ith item in the table)
3. From GDTR get the address of GDT
4. Combine the *section selector* and get the corresponding section selector from GDT
5. From that *section selector* get the *base address* of *interrupt handler*
   * handler entry address = section base address + offset
6. Check the privilege, make sure it's allow to access the segment
   * Make sure CPL (in CS Register) ≤ Gate descriptor DPL
     * Prevent user application access special trap gate or interrupt gate
   * Make sure RPL (in CS Register) ≤ Section descriptor DPL
     * Make sure current privilege greater than the privilege of interrupt handler

> * CPL Current privilege level
> * RPL Requested privilege level (privilege level associated with a segment selector)
> * DPL Descriptor privilege level (privilege level of a segment)
>   * It defines the minimum1 privilege level required to access the segment.
>
> Privilege levels range from 0-3; lower numbers are more privileged.

### 3. Storage System

#### Storage Hierarchy

```txt
          Register <--> Cache <--> Memory <--> Disk
Speed     Fast ------------------------------> Slow
Capacity  Small ------------------------------> Big
Cost      High -------------------------------> Low
```

#### Locality of Storage Access

> aka. principle of locality

* [wiki - Locality of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference)

#### Memory Block

* Byte, Bit
* [Page Frame](MemoryManagement.md#(Page)-Frame) (物理頁、頁框、頁幀)
  * Block / Page size
    * 512B, 1KB, 4KB, ..., 256KB, 1MB, 4MB, 16MB

#### Cache

Cache (SRAM) 快取記憶體、高速緩存

```txt
┌-----┐                                 ┌-------┐                          ┌--------┐
| CPU | <--- Byte or Word transfer ---> | Cache | <--- Block transfer ---> | Memory |
└-----┘                                 └-------┘                          └--------┘
```

### 4. I/O Access

* Program Control
* Interrupt Trigger
* Direct Memory Access (DMA)

Blocking I/O and Non-blocking I/O

![Two I/O methods: (a) synchronous and (b) asynchronous](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/images/Chapter13/13_08_Two_IO_Methods.jpg)

#### Program-based I/O

> Polling aka. Programmed I/O

CPU has to check the I/O status => waste lost of time on polling the status

#### Interrupt-based I/O

To solve the problem of "polling". It will free the CPU from polling.

Parallelize the I/O and the other instructions

Send the interrupt when I/O unit is ready to interact with the device

#### DMA-based I/O

The interrupt-based I/O is not efficient enough.

Use a individual unit DMA controller

* [Wiki - Direct memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access)

### 5. Timer

> TCON (Timer Control register)

Timer is necessary in the following scenario

* Found infinity loop
* Round Robin algorithm in interactive system
* Time delay and Time exceed control in real-time system
* Execute some external event for a time duration
* ...

#### Clock

* absolute clock: record current time (will advance even when shutdown)
* relative clock: implement by clock register
  * clock-- for a time unit, when the value become negative, then do something

- hardware clock
- software clock

## System Call

A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.

System call provides the services of the operating system to the user programs via Application Program Interface (API) (Library)

Trap the CPU state from user state to kernel mode

![syscall](https://sciencerack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/s-calls-min.jpg)

> Kernel Function
>
> Example: printf
>
> printf() --> write() (syscall)

### System Call Design

* Interrupt/Exception Mechanism
  * implement the services
* Trap Instruction/Privilege Instruction
  * switch between user state and kernel state
* System call number and parameter
  * number each syscall
* System call table
  * store the *function pointer address* for each syscall's service handler

> In Linux, each system call is assigned a unique syscall number that is used to reference a specific system call.

#### Passing Parameter

> Passing parameter from user program to kernel

* Trap instruction with argument
  * limited paramter number
* General purpose register
  * can be accessed by both user and system
  * limited register number
    * it's completely fine in 64bit system
  * e.g. Nachos (MIPS) (r2 register)
* Special purpose stack heap area in memory

> `return` is also a syscall (No. 1)

Ctrl + C

Soft interrupt

send a signal --> .... -> ....

### System Call Procedure

When CPU execute special trap instruction

1. Interrup/Exception mechanism: **Protect** state by hardware
   * Lookup the IVT
   * Pass the authority for syscall entry function
2. Invoke entry function: **Preserve** state
   * Preserve the parameters into kernel stack
   * Pass the authority for the syscall handler
   * e.g. `sysenter`
3. Execute *system call handler*
4. **Resume** state and back to user program

### System Call in Linux (based on x86)

> [include/linux/syscalls.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/syscalls.h)

System call number

> [arch/sh/include/uapi/asm/unistd_64.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/sh/include/uapi/asm/unistd_64.h)

```c
#define __NR_restart_syscall	  0
#define __NR_exit		  1
#define __NR_fork		  2
#define __NR_read		  3
#define __NR_write		  4
#define __NR_open		  5
#define __NR_close		  6
#define __NR_waitpid		  7
#define __NR_creat		  8
#define __NR_link		  9
#define __NR_unlink		 10
#define __NR_execve		 11
#define __NR_chdir		 12
#define __NR_time		 13
...
```

In Linux, all the system call use the same single entrance `int`: 0x80

```c
#define __NR_init_module	128
```

1. Change privilege => change stack
    * From User stack to Kernel stack
    * CPU assign a new stack pointer (SS: ESP) which point to kernel stack in TSS (Task State Segment)
2. Push `EFLAGS` into stack, resume TF (Trap Frame), IF stay remain
3. Find the gate descriptor in IDT by 0x80. Find the segment selector assign to CS (Code Segment) register
4. Calculate the "base address of segment descriptor" + "offset in the trap gate descripter" to locate the entry address of the system call handler

* Privilege check
  * code can only access same or lower privilege data
* System call number and arguments/parameters
  * EAX: for system call number, and the return value (after handle the system call)
    * e.g. Nachos (MIPS) r2 register
  * EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI

#### OS low-level procedure after interrupt

1. (Hardware) Push stack
   * PC, etc.
2. (Hardware) Insert new PC from interrupt vector
3. (Assembly) Preserve value of registers
4. (Assembly) Set new stack and heap
5. (C language) Execute interrupt handler
6. (CPU Scheduler) Decide next process
7. (C language) Return to Assembly
8. (Assembly) Start running new process
