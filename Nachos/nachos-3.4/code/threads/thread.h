// thread.h 
//	Data structures for managing threads.  A thread represents
//	sequential execution of code within a program.
//	So the state of a thread includes the program counter,
//	the processor registers, and the execution stack.
//	
// 	Note that because we allocate a fixed size stack for each
//	thread, it is possible to overflow the stack -- for instance,
//	by recursing to too deep a level.  The most common reason
//	for this occuring is allocating large data structures
//	on the stack.  For instance, this will cause problems:
//
//		void foo() { int buf[1000]; ...}
//
//	Instead, you should allocate all data structures dynamically:
//
//		void foo() { int *buf = new int[1000]; ...}
//
//
// 	Bad things happen if you overflow the stack, and in the worst 
//	case, the problem may not be caught explicitly.  Instead,
//	the only symptom may be bizarre segmentation faults.  (Of course,
//	other problems can cause seg faults, so that isn't a sure sign
//	that your thread stacks are too small.)
//	
//	One thing to try if you find yourself with seg faults is to
//	increase the size of thread stack -- ThreadStackSize.
//
//  	In this interface, forking a thread takes two steps.
//	We must first allocate a data structure for it: "t = new Thread".
//	Only then can we do the fork: "t->fork(f, arg)".
